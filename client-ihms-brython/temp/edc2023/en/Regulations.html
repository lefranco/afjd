</ul>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">All rounds and all
tables will be played in 7 years, 30 minutes per year.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>The deadlines for
each phase are as follows </b>: <br/>
Spring: negotiations 8',
writing of orders 1' , reading of orders 4'; 
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Summer (retreats):

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In the event of an
insufficient number of people registered for a round, the tournament
management reserves the right to propose the application of the
Sandard variant (game without Turkey with Turkey represented by a
neutral center and Romania without a center) or any another suitable
variant.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">If the number of
people does not allow to play all the tables of a round with the same
number of people per table, the tournament management may ask some
people to withdraw, or to play on two tables. If no solution is
found, priority will be given to people according to their ranking.
For the first round, or in case of a tie, priority will be given to
the person who has traveled the most to come.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">If there are 28
people (or more) ranked with a strictly positive result after the
third round, there will be a final table. The person winning the
final table will win the tournament, even if someone else scores more
points than them over the entire tournament. Each person at the final
table will choose their country (first step: each person, from the
lowest ranked to the highest ranked, chooses at what point in
relation to the others they wish to choose their country; second
step: each person chooses their country in order In the event of a
tie, the person who chose their country last, among the first ties,
wins the title).</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Rewards </b>:
<br/>
The people on the podium of the tournament and the best
countries will be rewarded <b>.</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Behavior</b>
<br/>
Some rules of behavior to follow for the tournament:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><i>Diplomacy </i>is
	an alliance game but not a team game, everyone plays for themselves,
	players must start each part of the tournament with the aim of
	optimizing their rankings and number of points in it</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">the players
	must respect each other, the exchanges between participants must
	remain cordial in all cases (betrayals are part of the game)</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">players must
	fight through adversity and not abandon or excessively rush their
	eliminations in the event of a hard blow: players must study and try
	to put in place the best stratagem to get back into the game instead
	of practicing this type of anti -game which excessively favors a few
	players to the detriment of others (remember that there is a great
	risk that the players who would be favored in the event of anti-play
	are those you would least like to see favored and vice versa, the
	most penalized players those who you would like to see the most
	favored). Total victory or first place in the game, objectives at
	the start of the game, must sometimes be reconsidered during the
	game and there is no shame in only aiming for a place of honor or
	survival. In addition, alliances are changeable, a player in
	difficulty, not presenting the first threat for the majority of
	players in the game, will very often be the ideal ally and will be
	able to get back on track.</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">if a player is
	authorized to have secret intentions to ally with another even
	before the start of the game, the fact remains that it is prohibited
	to have pre-established alliances, to join the tournament to play
	with or inviting other players to the tournament with the deliberate
	intention of allying with those other players. The game and the
	negotiation must take precedence and the pre-game secret intentions
	must yield to the game configurations</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">any
	communication on an unfinished game must be done in the game, it is
	forbidden for a person not playing a game to interfere with it by
	exchanging about it with a player still alive in the game, or by
	commenting or discussing the game in front of a player who is still
	alive in the game.</p>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
	<li><h1 class="western" style="font-variant: small-caps; margin-bottom: 0.2in">
	C – Table scoring system</h1>
</ol>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">
The system used to count points on each table is identical to that
used for the French championship in 2022:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">If there is no
	solo (a solo being a person finishing the game with at least 18
	centers), each person will win:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">1 point per
		center held by its country</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">1 point per
		center held by each other country having <b>strictly </b>less</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">1 point per
		surviving country on the game</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">1 point per
		center remaining neutral until the end of the game</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A bonus
		depending on its ranking in number of centers on the table</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">1st : 9
			<sup>points</sup></p>
			<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">2nd : 6
			<sup>points</sup></p>
			<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">3rd : 3
			<sup>points</sup></p>
			<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">4th : <sup>1
			</sup>point</p>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 1in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">NB:
in the event of a tie for a position, people will share the bonus
points. For example, if the top three people are tied at 10 centers,
each of them will add (9+6+3)/3=6 points. The next person will score
points for fourth place.</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In the case of
	“solo” (a person holds strictly more than half of the centers
	following an adjustment):</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The game ends
		immediately</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The person
		ahead normally scores their points as if everyone had survived,
		then doubles that score. (i.e. 100 points for 7 players if all
		centers are occupied)</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The others
		score 0.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p class="western" style="text-indent: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">
<b>Notes </b>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A victory
	without a tie with 7 surviving countries will therefore
	systematically be worth 50 points, or 100 points in the case of a
	solo. In the case of Sandard, the victory with 6 survivors will
	systematically be worth 46 points, and the solo 92 points.</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">By
	construction, a victory of a single country in the lead
	systematically earns more than a second place, this is not always
	true for second and third place</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Reminder: the
		victory of a single country in the lead earning the fewest points
		is the one where there would be only three survivors, ie 46 points.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The second
		highest scoring place is at 6 centers for a person in the lead at 7
		centers, with 7 countries surviving. This second place is therefore
		worth 6 + 21 + 7 + 6 = 40 points</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Second place
		with the lowest points is at 16 centers for a person in the lead at
		17 centers, with 3 surviving countries. This second place is
		therefore worth 16 + 1 + 3 + 6 = 26 points</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Attention!
		Third place with the most points is at 5 centers for a person in
		the lead at 7 centers and a second at 6 centers, with 7 countries
		surviving. This third place is therefore worth 5 + 16 + 7 + 3 = 31
		points. On the other hand, only the second places with the sum
		(number of centers of the first + number of survivors eliminated)
		greater than or equal to 16 are worse than this best third place.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><a name="__DdeLink__2_361311457"></a>
		The best fourth place (5 centers behind three tied at 6 centers,
		with 7 survivors) is worth 24 points</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">By
	construction, the more centers the people better ranked on the table
	than oneself have, the fewer points one has</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Most of the
	time, there is no point in scoring to eliminate a country. For a
	country alone in the lead, there is never one, and for a country in
	the lead tied, only if it allows to come out at the head of the tie.
	For other countries, eliminating a player is only of interest if you
	take the centers yourself (since you reduce the number of survivors,
	and therefore the number of points).</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The eliminated
	people still score the points corresponding to the number of
	survivors. Losing his last centers still means losing two points:
	the point of the center, and the point of his survival...</p>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A tie win will
	earn all fewer points than the number of centers is high:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">two people
		tied in the lead with 6 centers and 7 survivors (best tied with
		two) will score 42.5 points. Losing a centers to the other tie (by
		taking it or not) therefore earns 7.5 points.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">two people
		tied for the lead with 10 centers and 7 survivors will score 38.5
		points. Losing a centers to the other tie (by taking it or not)
		therefore earns 11.5 points.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">two lonely
		survivors  at 17 centers will only score 26.5 points (but breaking
		the tie then leads to solo ), worse than most second-placers.
		Here, it is the number of centers of people having as many or more
		than oneself, that decreases the score.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">three people
		tied for the lead with 6 centers and 7 survivors (best three-way
		tie) will score 35 points. Taking a centers from one of the other
		tied teams therefore earns 15 points.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">three people
		tied for the lead with 11 centers and 4 survivors will score 22
		points. Taking a centers from one of the other tied teams therefore
		earns 25 points.</p>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p class="western" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in">When
we are tied in the lead, it is therefore in our interest to hit the
others in the lead</p>

	adjudiction via a platform</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">If all players
		(without exception) in the game agree to use a platform, orders can
		be entered on Conspiracy or Diplomania (in a game created for the
		occasion or in the sandbox) or on any other online platform,
		ideally with a person not playing at the table who will act as
		electronic game master. On a few rare rules details, the
		adjudiction may differ, conflicts will be resolved in accordance
		with the regulations of the French Championship / Anjou Feu 2023.
		In this case, the map on the platform will then have to be
		corrected if necessary or, if impossible, there will have mandatory
		return to the table game only. In all cases, even with electronic
		assistance, the game displayed on the table must be up to date.</p>
	</ul>
	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Reading
	orders</b></p>
	<ul>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">For the first
		seasons (P01 to P03), players will start by reading the orders of
		beginners as a priority.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Irrespective
		of the applicable penalties, the referee may instruct a person to
		give his orders immediately in the event of a delay (see point B
		“tournament format”). If this is not done, the orders will not
		be taken into account at adjudiction.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A unit without
		orders at the end of a movement phase will be considered to be in
		civil disorder. It can be supported in defense.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A unit having
		to retreat and having no order or an invalid order will be
		dispersed.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In the event
		of a missing or invalid build order, there will be no build (except
		in the first year, when the referee will impose up to two builds –
		no third build – to maintain a balance in the game).</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In the event
		of a supernumerary build order, the lowest written orders are kept.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In the event
		of a missing or invalid debuild order (beyond valid orders), the
		missing debuilds will be carried out according to Renegade rule 202
		3, i.e.:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">the units
			farthest from the centers belonging to this nation, i.e. separated
			by the greatest number of regions, regardless of the nature (land
			or sea) or the situation (occupied or unoccupied) of the regions
			considered</p>
			<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">fleets before
			land armies</p>
			<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">lastly, in
			priority the provinces in which these units are located first in
			alphabetical order in English (lowest number in the list appearing
			in section G of the rules)</p>
		</ul>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">If a nation
		loses and gains centers during the same year, it will not and
		cannot demobilize units and at the same time mobilize others. We
		will only look at whether it has more centers than units (potential
		builds) or more units than centers (mandatory debuilds).</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A unit
		receiving several different orders will be considered civil
		disorder, even if some of the orders were invalid.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A support
		order does not require mentioning the type of unit supported.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">A missing or
		incomplete order for a unit will be considered valid if the order
		for this unit is complete in the support or convoy order written
		for another unit of the same nationality (unless the incomplete
		order is also a valid with a different meaning than the full
		order). Example: A BRE and F ATL C BRE – POR. Similarly, a
		missing or incomplete convoy order will be considered valid if the
		order for that unit is the only one possible to make possible a
		convoy attack order written by another unit of the same
		nationality. Example: A BRE – POR and F ATL C BRE</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">If no
		electronic adjudiction: ideally, a player or a referee reads the
		order sheets of all the players. If it is a player who reads the
		sheets, he will start with the sheets of the beginner players then
		with his own (under the control of another player or will have his
		sheet read), before reading the sheets of the more experienced
		players; another player or referee moves the units on the map
		according to the reading. The &quot;reader&quot; and the &quot;mover&quot;
		must solve the best and in a neutral way but will not be solely
		responsible for the adjudiction, the other players will have to
		report any error in adjudiction. It is requested to follow the
		reading of the orders in silence and to wait for the end of it
		before any comment.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">If the next
		phase is well underway, in particular if the following orders have
		already been issued, a adjudiction error cannot and must not be
		corrected, the game continuing as is.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">Players
		outside the game will also be able to help resolve the game if they
		are not playing this round or if their game is over but must
		refrain from any comment on the game in progress, whether during
		the adjudiction, during trading or writing orders.</p>
		<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">In all cases,
		an unambiguous order must be applied and an order deemed ambiguous
		not applied. For the interest of the game and the tournament
		(demand for quality, atmosphere of the game, etc.), the right
		balance between rigor and tolerance will have to be sought. A
		particular tolerance towards beginners or players who have not
		played for a long time will facilitate the integration of new
		players: in order to facilitate corrections, as indicated above,
		the order sheets of beginners will be read first, at least in start
		of the game. At the end of the game or from the start of the game,
		if it only includes experienced players, for the sake of fairness,
		there may be rotation between the player who sees his sheet read
		first. For accepted abbreviations, you can refer to the table in
		section G.</p>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Public health:</b>
the national public health guidelines in force at the time of the
tournament will be applied. For example, in the event of coronavirus
involving the wearing of a mandatory mask or sanitary pass, these
will be required to participate.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Registration/pre-registration:</b>
a person is considered “pre-registered” for a round if he has
announced his participation in this round no later than the day
before the round. A person is considered “registered” for a round
if he has confirmed his participation at the earliest one hour before
the start of the round and at the latest 30 minutes before.</p>

the costs:</b> each person is free to participate or not in the
costs, on a strictly voluntary basis. The total cost of the
organization of the tournament (including sponsorship if relevant)
will be communicated on request to those wishing it. Participation,
deducted from any tournament endowment costs, will be paid in full to
the AFJD.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>Accommodation:</b>
No accommodation is provided. In any case, the tournament will take

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><b>List of territory
names</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The names in the
list are the names used in the American and French editions and the
abbreviations, those proposed in these same editions. Any abbreviated
notation appearing or not in the following table will be accepted as
long as the abbreviation is not subject to different interpretations;
an ambiguous order due to a disputed abbreviation will cause the
order to fail.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">The first rulebooks
in English did not give a list of abbreviations, so the first
communities of players created their own which may still be different
from all those that were subsequently offered in the official
American editions or the editions French. MAO or LYO, for example,
have been very often used (and still are) to refer to the
Mid-Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Lyon regions. Some communities have
also adopted the habit of designating the maritime provinces only in
capital letters and the terrestrial provinces in lower case (a habit
taken up by the recent Conspiracy platform); this way of doing
things, despite having been widely relayed, has however never been
taken up in the various rulebooks, apart from the Descartes edition
writing all the abbreviations in capital letters (including land
territories), the others editions put uppercase and lowercase letters
in the abbreviation in the same places as in the expanded name.</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0.14in">For all those who
write badly — there are some ;-) — we can only encourage to write
full names (i.e. not to abbreviate the name of the territory) or at
least to adopt methods limiting disputes (like the one in the
previous paragraph: maritime territory in capitals, land in
lowercase).</p>
