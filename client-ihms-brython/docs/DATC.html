<H3 CLASS="western">1. INTRODUCTION</H3>
<P>Writing an adjudicator computer program for the game Diplomacy
(TM) is not an easy job. Many adjudicator programs contain several
bugs on their first release and even after some years, when the most
severe bugs were removed, adjudication errors could still be found
for more complex situations. To achieve a high quality adjudicator,
the programmer has to overcome the following difficulties: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Different rulebooks. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Ambiguities in the rulebooks. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">An algorithm that is sophisticated
	enough to handle complex situations. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>Systematic testing of the adjudicator. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>This document is a guide in handling these problems. With this
document it is possible to write an adjudicator that is correct for
the first release. 
</P>
<P>The principle of this document is to give the reader information
and not to tell the reader how to do things. Therefore, all
information is presented as neutral as possible and given with
arguments or with reference to the source. 
</P>
<P>The primary sources of this document are the official English
rulebooks. The additional sources are the 1998 DPTG (Diplomacy
Players Technical Guide), comments from mister Calhamer (the creator
of the game), magazines from the publishers of the game, various
articles, discussions and house rules found on the internet. 
</P>
<P>A scientific approach has been taken to deal with all this
information. If there was evidence that a certain idea or opinion is
supported by a significant part of the Diplomacy (TM) community, then
it was added to this document. This makes this document the most
elaborated and complete source on the rules of Diplomacy (TM). Even
so, it was not possible to list everyone's individual opinion. 
</P>
<P>An overview of the official English rulebooks is given in chapter
<A HREF="#3">3</A>. These rulebooks have in certain cases a different
ruling and even when the latest rulebook is taken, then still some
rule issues exist. These issues are listed in chapter <A HREF="#4">4</A>
with the alternatives to handle them. An analysis of the process of
adjudication is in chapter <A HREF="#5">5</A>. Writing an adjudicator
program is a straight forward job with this analysis. Finally, an
adjudicator program needs to be tested in a systematic way and
chapter <A HREF="#6">6</A> contains an extensive list of test cases
with the expected resolution. 
</P>
<P>In case the rules are not clear on a certain situation, then the
alternatives are in the list of issues and in the test cases. To
prevent that the reader becomes lost in lots of choices I (Lucas B.
Kruijswijk) commented every rule issue. Those comments contain my
preference how the rule should be interpreted. In this way the reader
can start with these preferences and deviate where he or she wishes.
To make a clear distinction between the text that is not disputed and
my comments with my preferences, my comments are written in <I>italics</I>.
Note however, that my preferences are based on an extensive study on
the rules. Although you may dispute them, the choices are certainly
very acceptable within the Diplomacy(TM) community. 
</P>
<P>With the elaborated information about the rules, this document can
also be used by people that judge a game manually. The preferences
can be used as default house rules in case the own house rules of the
judge does not cover a certain topic. 
</P>
<P>The version of this document consists of two numbers. The first
number will change and only change, when one or more preferences
changes. The second one, is a sequence number. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="2"></A>In chapter <A HREF="#7">7</A> and further variants
are handled. Variants are games that follow the rules of Diplomacy
with a different map or with some additional rules. The chapters on
variants are not complete yet. For instance, Air Units and
Machiavelli are not handled yet. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">2. 2000 RULEBOOK/DATC COMPLIANCY</H3>
<P>Everyone is free to interpret the rules as he or she wants. But
people want to know, which rules are used. Therefore, the term '2000
rulebook/DATC compliant' is introduced. An automated adjudicator may
call itself '2000 rulebook/DATC compliant' when the following
requirements are met: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The 2000 rules are followed. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">For the cases where the 2000 rules
	are not clear, the preferences in this document must be followed.
	This only counts for the issues <A HREF="#4.A.1">4.A.1</A>, <A HREF="#4.A.2">4.A.2</A>,
	<A HREF="#4.A.3">4.A.3</A>, <A HREF="#4.A.4">4.A.4</A>, <A HREF="#4.A.5">4.A.5</A>,
	<A HREF="#4.A.6">4.A.6</A>, <A HREF="#4.A.7">4.A.7</A>, <A HREF="#4.B.1">4.B.1</A>,

	<A HREF="#4.E.4">4.E.4</A> and <A HREF="#4.E.5">4.E.5</A>. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The adjudicator must pass all test
	cases of the standard game according to the preferences of the
	mentioned issues. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">In case the adjudicator is in the
	English language and uses abbreviations for reporting, then the
	abbreviations of the 2000 rules must be used. The adjudicator may
	accept other abbreviations. The abbreviation for 'Denmark' is 'Den'
	(not listed in the 2000 rules). 
	</P>
	<LI><P>The developers of the adjudicator must be devoted to resolve
	any reported bug in adjudication in the next update of the
	adjudicator. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The idea of the DATC is not to enforce one way of interpretation
of the rules. Therefore, you may call an adjudicator '2000
rulebook/DATC compliant' as long as you list the deviations with the
specified requirements. However, the adjudicator may not fail on any
of the test cases (of course, the results must be according to chosen
preferences). Deviations does not need to be listed, when they can be
turned off or when it is an extension in a client program that does
not change anything when it is not used (for instance choice b for
<A HREF="#4.A.6">4.A.6</A>, choice a for <A HREF="#4.E.4">4.E.4</A>
and choice a for <A HREF="#4.E.5">4.E.5</A>). 
</P>
<P><A NAME="3"></A>Developers are considered to be honorable persons
and may perform verification by their selves. After an update of the
DATC an adjudicator does not need to be retested to keep the status
of '2000 rulebook/DATC compliant'. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">3. HISTORY OF RULES</H3>
<P>Allan Calhamer started the development of Diplomacy in 1953.
However the first commercial version was not on the market before
1959. So, the first real rulebook is from 1959. 
</P>
<P>Games Research bought the rights of Diplomacy in 1960 and their
first edition was in 1961. Except from some restyling and the
copyright notice of Games Research, the rules of 1961 are not
different from the 1959 rules. These rulebooks have many ambiguities
and are rather useless. Dealing with the issues of these rulebooks is
out of the scope of this document. 
</P>
<P>Most of the issues of the 1959 and 1961 rulebooks were identified
and addressed in the 1971 rulebook. The 1971 rulebook is the first
mature rulebook. Since this rulebook has been popular for a long time
and maybe still people play according to these rules, the differences
with newer rulebooks are all explained in this document. 
</P>
<P>In 1976 Avalon Hill bought the rights from Games Research. In
their first edition in 1976, they kept the rules the same and they
only put their own name on the rulebook. In this document, only to
the first appearance of a set of rules is referred. That means that
the 1971/1976 rulebooks are referred as the 1971 rulebook in this
document. 
</P>
<P>In 1982 Avalon Hill made a new edition of the game and made some
small, but significant changes to the rules. These changes include
the multi-route convoy disruption rule (see issue <A HREF="#4.A.1">4.A.1</A>),
convoy disruption paradox rule (see issue <A HREF="#4.A.2">4.A.2</A>)
and some clarifications on convoying to adjacent places (see issue
<A HREF="#4.A.3">4.A.3</A>). 
</P>
<P>In 1992 Avalon Hill they introduced the 'Diplomacy de Luxe'
edition. The rulebook was restyled, but the rules are identical to
the 1982 rules. The rulebook does also contain a list of
abbreviations for the provinces. Since, the rules did not change, the
1982/1992 rulebooks are referred as the 1982 rulebook in this
document. 
</P>
<P>In 1998 Avalon Hill was bought by Hasbro and in 2000 the first
Hasbro edition emerged. Note that you can see the year 2000 on the
front page of the rulebook, however the copyright notice on the last
page says 1999. Some people refer to this rules as the 1999 rules. In
this document it is assumed that the front page is read more than the
last page and therefore these rules are referred to as the 2000
rules. To make the rules more readable, the rules were completely
rewritten. Edi Birsan was the main contributor to this rulebook.
Except from restyling, there are also some real changes to the rules.
The unpopular 1982 convoy, disruption paradox rule (see issue <A HREF="#4.A.2">4.A.2</A>)
was changed again. The issue on convoys to adjacent provinces was
further clarified (see issue <A HREF="#4.A.3">4.A.3</A>). Waiving
builds is explicitly allowed (see issue <A HREF="#4.D.7">4.D.7</A>)
and you can very well interpret the rules in such way that they do
not allow the refusal of support by ordering an illegal order (see
issue <A HREF="#4.E.1">4.E.1</A>). Also a significant change in the
abbreviations of the provinces (note that the abbreviation of
'Denmark' is missing). 
</P>
<P>Unfortunately there are a few changes in the 2000 rulebook that
made things worse than the 1982 rules. A rather minor issue is the
removal of units in civil disorder (see issue <A HREF="#4.D.8">4.D.8</A>).
In the 1971 and the 1982 rulebooks this was already rather vague, but
in the 2000 rules it is really a mess. A more serious error is that
it was forgotten to say that a failed convoy due to dislodged
convoying fleets, has no influence on the destination province. Page
12 of the 2000 rulebook: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dislodgement of a fleet in a convoy causes the convoy to
fail. If a Fleet ordered to convoy is dislodged during the turn, the
Army to be convoyed remains in its original province. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>While rule XII.3 of the 1971 and 1982 rules say: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>DISRUPTING A CONVOY. If a fleet ordered to convoy is
dislodged during the turn, the army to be convoyed remains in its
original province and has no effect on the province to which it was
ordered. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>There are several reasons to assume that the 2000 rulebook was not
intended like this and that this must be considered an error in the
rules. First of all, Edi Birsan the main contributor to the 2000
rulebook, confirmed that this was not intended. Second, there is
evidence in the rulebook itself that the rule should be read as the
1971/1982 rule. The whole page 16 would become unnecessary if
convoying armies can still cut support when the convoy is dislodged
(there are no paradoxes anymore). But especially the following phrase
on that page is clear evidence: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Italy could argue that dislodgement of the Fleet
disrupted the convoy so that the Army could not arrive in Naples to
cut the support. (Italy could state the rule, &quot;Dislodgement of a
fleet in a convoy causes the convoy to fail.&quot;) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Since in the research for this document no evidence was found that
there is a significant group of people that actually play that a
disrupted convoy can still cut support (or bounce another unit), this
is not listed as a disputable issue in chapter <A HREF="#4">4</A>,
but just treated as an error and that the 1971/1982 rule was meant. 
</P>
<P>Finally, there are numerous alternative rulebooks. For instance
the rulebook of the variant Colonial Diplomacy. This rulebook is
based on the 1971 rules (although the copyright is after 1982) and is
discussed in chapter <A HREF="#7">7</A>. Furthermore there are
several translated rulebooks made for non-English versions of
Diplomacy. These are not treated in this document. With the 2000
edition also an CD-ROM version was released by Hasbro/Avalon
Hill/Microprose. This program has a tutorial for the rules. In the
research of this document no additional information could be found
about whether this version contains a paper rulebook and if it is any
different from the rulebook supplied with the board game. So,
obviously this version is not handled in this document and if it
exists and it contains the 1999 or 2000 copyright notice, then we
still refer to the rulebook of the board game when the 2000 rulebook
is mentioned. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="4"></A>As last remark must be said that according to some
reliable sources, Allan Calhamer has the right to veto any changes to
the rules. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">4. DISPUTABLE ISSUES</H3>
<P>When playing Diplomacy, there is one golden rule. Making orders
public is irreversible. If during a turn someone discovers that the
adjudication was wrong, this can be corrected and even when the
orders are submitted, the orders can discarded and be rewritten.
However, when the orders are made public, the players have shown
their true intentions and it is not possible to hide them again. 
</P>
<P>This golden rule has two consequences. First, when the orders are
made public, the adjudication of the previous turn, becomes final.
Changing the adjudication of a previous turn, would lead to a big
mess. Second, when the orders are made public, a decision has to be
made on those orders. This may lead to a serious dispute between the
players, when those orders are not clear or the rulebook is
disputable on the situation. Therefore, the main focus is on issues
related to the pieces on the board and interpreting the written
orders (some of them are irrelevant for an automated adjudicator, but
are listed nevertheless). So, the problem of assigning powers to the
players is not discussed, since this can easily be handled by the
players. 
</P>
<P>The geography of the map is not disputed and therefore not
discussed. To surprise to some new players, Norway is connected to St
Petersburg both for army as for fleet, but this is not disputed.
Although also not disputed, on some maps it is not completely clear,
that Liverpool is connected to North Atlantic Ocean and Clyde is not
connected to Irish Sea. 
</P>
<P>The issues in this chapter are not a FAQ (Frequently Asked

DISRUPTION</H4>
<P>When a convoy has multiple routes, the question rises when the
convoy is disrupted. 
</P>
<P>The following interpretations are possible: 
</P>
<OL TYPE=a>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The convoy is disrupted when one

</OL>
<P>The 1971 rule has as disadvantage that a player that has a fleet
that is almost certainly dislodged, can give an &quot;unwanted
convoy&quot; as in test case <A HREF="#6.F.10">6.F.10</A>. The DPTG
avoids this problem by skipping any foreign units from a convoy when
there is a route without foreign units. However, this solves the
problem only partially. When there is no route without foreign units
and there are two routes with each a different foreign fleet, it can
not be decided based on the orders whether one of the convoy orders
is unwanted (see test case <A HREF="#6.F.11">6.F.11</A>). Probably
due to these issues the rule was changed in the 1982 rulebook.

<H4 CLASS="western">4.A.2. CONVOY DISRUPTION PARADOXES</H4>
<P>A convoy disruption paradox is a situation with a possible
disrupted convoy and for which the rules give no resolution or more
than one resolution. 
</P>
<P>Some people argue that some situations are not convoy paradoxes,
since the rules give a resolution for those situations. Hence, for a
proper discussion on paradoxes, rule XII.5 of the 1971, 1976, 1982
and 1992 rulebooks and the rule on the top of page 16 of the 2000
rulebook, should not be taken into account in the above definition of
a paradox. 
</P>
<P>In case of a paradox, the smallest subset of orders for which the
paradox still exists, is the core of the paradox. In case there are
several independent paradoxes on the board, then it is possible that
there are two different subsets of orders with the same number of
orders. In that case, just one can be taken to proceed. Since the
paradoxes are independent it doesn't matter which one is handled
first. 
</P>
<P>The following ways for handling convoy disruption paradoxes are
possible: 
</P>
<OL TYPE=a>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The 1971 rule about this issue
	is:<BR>&quot;If a convoyed army attacks a fleet which is supporting
	a fleet which is attacking one of the convoy fleets, that support is
	not cut.&quot; This rule has a few drawbacks. The rule does not have
	a resolution for second order paradoxes (see test cases <A HREF="#6.F.22">6.F.22</A>,
	<A HREF="#6.F.23">6.F.23</A>, and <A HREF="#6.F.24">6.F.24</A>) and
	the betrayal paradox (see test case <A HREF="#6.F.18">6.F.18</A>).
	In some cases it conflicts with the dislodge rule, although, the
	common interpretation is that this rule takes precedence (see test
	case <A HREF="#6.F.17">6.F.17</A>). Finally, when multi-route
	convoys are allowed and when such convoys are only disrupted when
	all routes are disrupted (note that this is not the case in the 1971
	rulebook), it may result to some strange adjudication in some rare
	situations (see test case <A HREF="#6.F.19">6.F.19</A>). 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The 1982 rule about this issue
	is:<BR>&quot;If a convoyed army attacks a fleet which is supporting
	an action in a body of water; and that body of water contains a
	convoying fleet, that support is not cut. &quot;. The advantage of
	this rule is that it is a simple and effective rule that eliminates
	all paradoxes. Compared to other rules that eliminate all paradoxes,
	it is the easiest rule to program in an adjudicator. However, the
	disadvantage is that it effects not only the paradoxical situations,
	but also many other cases. This has as consequence that players can
	do tricks with this rule to take advantage (see test cases <A HREF="#6.F.20">6.F.20</A>
	and <A HREF="#6.F.21">6.F.21</A>). It is also not clear what a
	&quot;convoying fleet&quot; means. Does it mean a fleet that is
	ordered to convoy? Or must there be at least an army that tries to
	convoy? Or must there be a possible route? Finally, as with the 1971
	rule, it conflicts with the dislodge rule in some cases, although,
	the common interpretation is that this rule takes precedence (see
	test case <A HREF="#6.F.17">6.F.17</A>).

	for the changed multi-route convoy disruption rule (see issue <A HREF="#4.A.1">4.A.1</A>)
	which was introduced in the 1982 rulebook. This has as advantage
	that it leads to more logical adjudication in case of multi-route
	convoys (see test case <A HREF="#6.F.19">6.F.19</A>). It has also
	all disadvantages of the 1971 rule. So, the rule does not have a

	Also, in some cases it conflicts with the dislodge rule and again

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Simon Szykman alternative
	(reworded):<BR>&quot;If a situation arises in which an army's convoy
	order results in a paradoxical adjudication, the moves of all
	involved convoying armies fail and have no effect on the place where
	they were ordered to convoy.&quot;. This rule was proposed by Simon
	Szykman in a discussion with Manus Hand in the Diplomatic Pouch Zine
	(1999, Fall Retreat). Manus Hand defended the 1982 rule. In almost
	all situations this results in the same adjudication as the 2000
	rule. Only in case that the convoying fleet dislodges a unit (see
	test case <A HREF="#6.F.17">6.F.17</A>) the result is different.
	However, as said before you must assume that the 2000 paradox rule
	takes precedence over the dislodge rule in this specific case. If
	this assumption is not made, then the 2000 rulebook does not have a
	resolution for this case and then it can be defended that the
	Szykman rule is compatible with the 2000 rulebook. The advantage of
	the Szykman rule is that it also has a resolution for second order
	paradoxes (see test cases <A HREF="#6.F.22">6.F.22</A>, <A HREF="#6.F.23">6.F.23</A>
	and <A HREF="#6.F.24">6.F.24</A>). Another advantage is that it
	works for paradoxes that can occur with convoyable coastal areas
	that appear in some variants (see test cases <A HREF="#9.E">9.E</A>,
	<A HREF="#9.F">9.F</A> and <A HREF="#9.G">9.G</A>). A disadvantage

<P>Several people proposed alternatives for the paradox problem.
However, only the suggestions above have significant support from the

<H4 CLASS="western">4.A.3. CONVOYING TO ADJACENT PLACE</H4>
<P>It is allowed to convoy to an adjacent place. This can be used to
swap two units (such as in test case <A HREF="#6.G.1">6.G.1</A>). If
the units are ordered in such way that a convoy to an adjacent place
is possible, the question arises whether the convoy route must be
considered or the land route. 
</P>
<P>It can not just be said that the land route is taken or the convoy
route, comparable with the multiple convoy routes rule. The reason
for this is that different rules apply in the different situations.
If an army takes the land route and the unit on the target area moves
in the opposite direction, then there is a head to head battle. While
in case of the convoy route there is no head to head battle. If the
attacked unit is dislodged by the head to head battle, the attacked
unit has no effect on the area from which it is attacked, while in
case of a convoy it still has effect (see test cases <A HREF="#6.G.9">6.G.9</A>
and <A HREF="#6.G.10">6.G.10</A>). It is also possible that the
convoy route is only available when the land route is taken (see test
case <A HREF="#6.G.11">6.G.11</A>). Finally it has a relation with
the issue of cutting support by a convoy to adjacent place (see
<A HREF="#4.A.4">4.A.4</A>) and the issue of retreat after dislodged
by a convoy to adjacent place (see <A HREF="#4.A.5">4.A.5</A>). 
</P>
<P>For these reasons it must be clear which route is taken at some
point during adjudication.

<P>The following interpretations are possible: 
</P>
<OL TYPE=a>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The 1971 rulebook does not have a
	rule that specifies which route has to be taken. The simplest
	solution is to choose always the convoy route above the land route.
	The disadvantage of this interpretation is that all kinds of army
	&quot;kidnapping&quot; are possible. This can result in an
	unexpected swap (see test case <A HREF="#6.G.2">6.G.2</A>), but also
	in rather unfair failures of moves with superior power (see test

	&quot;THE GAMER'S GUIDE TO DIPLOMACY&quot;, 2nd edition. The
	following can be found:</P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>11. Q: We think there is a conflict in the Rulebook.
	These orders might not occur often, but what if they do?<BR><BR>ENG:
	F Edi-Nth, F Lon S F Edi-Nth.<BR>FRA: F Nth C GERMAN A Hol-Bel.<BR>GER:
	A Hol-Bel.<BR><BR>Doesn't the disruption of the convoy prevent the
	German army from moving?<BR><BR>A: No. The Rules (VII.1, third
	paragraph) clearly state that an army may move to an adjacent
	province if unopposed. In this situation, the convoy order is not
	relevant to the army's ability to move from Holland to Belgium. Even
	if the F Nth were German, so that it was clear that the German
	player intended (for some arcane reason) that the army should move
	by convoy, Rule VII.1 would still operate to allow A Hol-Bel to
	succeed if unopposed. Actually, the only time you might expect to
	see an army convoyed between adjacent provinces is when an otherwise
	illegal exchange of units is taking place (see Rule XIV.5, third
	paragraph). Consider this situation:<BR><BR>ENG: F Edi-Nth, F Lon S
	F Edi-Nth.<BR>GER: F Bel-Hol, A Hol-Bel, F Nth C A Hol-Bel.<BR><BR>In
	this situation, the German F Nth is dislodged and the convoy is
	disrupted. The two German movement orders, both still legal, now
	boil down to a stand-off.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Given this information, the following
	rule can be defined: &quot;The land route is taken except when the
	unit in the target area moves in opposite direction.&quot;. This

	but some unwanted convoys are still possible as in test case <A HREF="#6.G.2">6.G.2</A>
	and <A HREF="#6.G.4">6.G.4</A>. An advantage of this rule is that
	issue <A HREF="#4.A.4">4.A.4</A> is not relevant anymore and the
	already theoretical issue <A HREF="#4.A.5">4.A.5</A> is even more
	theoretical. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The previous choice can be refined
	as follows: &quot;The land route is taken except when the unit in
	the target area moves in opposite direction and there is an
	undisrupted convoy route.&quot;. This means that first the convoy
	route must be adjudicated, before it can be decided whether the army
	moves over land or via convoy. The disadvantage is that adjudication
	is more complicated, because this is the only choice where the
	decision whether an army moves by convoy can not be decided before
	the real adjudication starts (see also <A HREF="#5.B.10">5.B.10</A>).
	However, it is possible to do a proper adjudication, because the
	units that move in opposite direction do not disturb any other order
	and therefore the convoys can adjudicated first. A paradoxical
	situation as in test <A HREF="#6.G.11">6.G.11</A>, does not lead to
	any issues. This rule prevents the kidnapping for all dislodging
	purposes as in test case <A HREF="#6.G.3">6.G.3</A> and <A HREF="#6.G.4">6.G.4</A>,
	however an unintended swap as in test case <A HREF="#6.G.2">6.G.2</A>

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The 1982 and 2000 ruling.<BR>The
	1982 rules say: &quot;BOTH A CONVOY ROUTE AND AN OVERLAND ROUTE. If
	an army could arrive at its destination either overland or by
	convoy, one route must be considered and the other disregarded,
	depending upon intent as shown by the totality of the orders written
	by the player governing the army&quot;. The &quot;intent&quot; is
	rather vague. In the 2000 rulebook this is completely rewritten. It
	is more specific and does not use the term &quot;intent&quot;.
	However, it does follow the principle of &quot;intent&quot; and
	therefore it is rather common to interpret the 1982 rules as the
	2000 rules the same. When in the 2000 rules, one of the convoying
	fleets is of the same nationality of the army that convoys, then the
	intent is to convoy. There is still a special case when the fleet of
	the same nationality indeed orders the army to convoy to the right
	place, but the fleet is not a part of an ordered convoy path (see
	test case <A HREF="#6.G.6">6.G.6</A>) or not part of a possible
	convoy path (see test case <A HREF="#6.G.7">6.G.7</A>). The 2000
	rulebook is not clear on this, but the most common interpretation is
	that when the fleet is part of a possible convoy path, the intent is
	still to convoy and therefore the convoy path should be chosen.
	However, if the fleet is not part of a possible convoy path, then
	the intent is to confuse the judge and therefore the land route
	should be taken. Furthermore, an impossible convoy order can be
	treated as illegal (see issue <A HREF="#4.E.1">4.E.1</A>) and in
	such case it is ignored anyway. When the order for the army contains
	the words &quot;via Convoy&quot; or &quot;by Convoy&quot; the intent
	is to convoy. Note that if there is only a land route possible, the
	intent is unimportant. That means that if the order contains &quot;via
	Convoy&quot; and there is no possible convoy route ordered, the land
	route should still be considered (see also test case <A HREF="#6.G.8">6.G.8</A>).

<P>There are two notations to order an army that it should use a

introduces quite a lot of details. Furthermore, in the research of
this document a case was found were two players (in a game played
with the 2000 rules) wanted to swap, but didn't give the orders
properly. It must be realized that a swap with a foreign fleet maybe
only happens one out of ten games. If a face to face game takes about
six hours, then you need sixty hours of play to have at least one
experience with the 'via Convoy' order. So, what is worse? Take also
into account that the kidnapping of armies is also fun. I advice that
if there is a new edition of the rules that choice c must be
considered (after analyzing a few dozen of games on the
consequences). For the moment I prefer to follow the rules and that

<BLOCKQUOTE>It's not phrased as a clarification of the &quot;cutting
support&quot; rule (Rule X) in the 1976 rules. I've now printed out a
copy of the 2000 rules from the Hasbro web site, and in the
explanation, it offers the example:<BR><BR>France: A Tun-Nap, F Tyn C
A Tun-Nap<BR>Italy: F Ion-Tyn, F Nap S F Ion-Tyn<BR><BR>The
explanatory text goes on to say that France could argue that support
is cut (thus preventing the convoy from being disrupted), citing the
rule, &quot;Support is cut if the unit giving support is attacked
from any province but the one where support is being given.&quot;
IOW, since the army is coming from Tunis, it would normally be
entitled to cut the support for F Ion-Tyn given by Naples, thereby
preventing the convoy from being disrupted. This &quot;new rule&quot;
(author's words) gives an exception to that rule, overriding the
usual rule and eliminating the paradox. This rule WOULD NOT BE
NECESSARY if the army were deemed to be coming from Tyn (the space
being attacked). But the author says it IS NECESSARY (&quot;...this
rule takes precedence&quot; [over the usual rule that would apply]),
therefore, the army MUST be deemed to come from Tun, and this rule
exists to provide an exception to avoid paradox. But it only applies
to a situation in which a convoy would be disrupted if the support is
effective, but not disrupted if the support is ineffective.
Therefore, for all other convoys, the ordinary interpretation should
be that the army is deemed to come from the province in which it
began the turn, and thus an army which can reach a province either
via land or via convoy cannot cut support for an action against the
province in which it started the turn, whether or not it is convoyed
to the supporting unit's province. QED.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stephen Agar sent this problem to Allan Calhamer (the creator of
Diplomacy). Before he got a response he followed up with the
arguments of Randy Hudson and Mike Lease. On the 24th of November
2001, Allan Calhamer responded: 
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Good argument. I had always thought of the Army as coming
from its province, not from the body of water, but your correspondent
appears to show actual rule support for the proposition.<BR>Best
regards, Allan</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>So, according to the creator the attack is coming from the
starting position of the army. 
</P>
<P>However, you can have also another view on this issue. If you look
to support as something that is passing a border, then the support is
not cut when the attack and support are clashing on the same border.
In case of a convoy, there is no such clash, so it would be more
logical to say that the support is cut (choice b). Taking this border
point of view, it would be preferred that the choice is consistent
with issues <A HREF="#4.A.5">4.A.5</A> and <A HREF="#4.A.7">4.A.7</A>.

<H4 CLASS="western">4.A.5. RETREAT WHEN DISLODGED BY CONVOY</H4>
<P>In a very rare situation (see test case <A HREF="#6.H.11">6.H.11</A>
and <A HREF="#6.H.12">6.H.12</A>) a unit can be dislodged by a convoy
from an adjacent place. Then the question arises whether the
dislodged unit may retreat to the starting place of the convoying
army. 
</P>
<P>The following two interpretations are possible: 
</P>
<OL TYPE=a>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The unit may not retreat to the

	<LI><P>The unit may retreat to the starting place of the attacker

</OL>
<P>First note that if issue <A HREF="#4.A.3">4.A.3</A> is played

extremely theoretical situation that both units attempted to move by

</P>
<P>All the rulebooks are ambiguous on this issue. They say first &quot;A
dislodged unit must retreat to an adjacent province that it could
ordinarily move to if unopposed by other units.&quot;. According to
this sentence the unit may retreat to the starting place of the
attacker (choice b). However, in further explanation all the
rulebooks say: &quot;The unit can not retreat to the province from
which the attacker came.&quot;. For the interpretation of the word
'from' see also issue <A HREF="#4.A.4">4.A.4</A>. This sentence must
be interpreted that the particular retreat is not allowed. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="4.A.6"></A><I>Since the rulebooks are ambiguous on this

attacking unit did not pass the border over which the retreating unit
wants to go, it is logical that this retreat is possible. So, I

<H4 CLASS="western">4.A.6. CONVOY PATH SPECIFICATION</H4>
<P>Some popular automated judges require that a path is specified for
the army that convoys. For instance: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">England: 
F North Sea Convoys A Yorkshire - Belgium
A Yorkshire - North Sea - Belgium </PRE><P>
This way of writing convoys has never been part of the official rules
and is also not according to the DPTG. According to some sources this
is because the person that wrote the first automated judge, did not
know how to write an algorithm that searches for a convoy path and
that since then it has never been changed. This is a little bit
strange story, since writing an algorithm that searches for a path is
much easier then writing an adjudicator. On the other hand the
quality of the first version of the adjudicator might not have been
that good. 
</P>
<P>The advantage of path specification is that it might easier to
code and that &quot;unwanted&quot; convoys are not possible. There
are four types of &quot;unwanted&quot; convoys:

<P><A NAME="4.A.7"></A><I>If path specification is required in a face

intents to convoy, but forgets the path. For instance, England orders
York to Holland with a fleet in the North Sea that is ordered to
convoy. If path specification is required, then the order from York
to Holland without path makes no sense. But, since we do a best
effort to interpret the orders, we may still decide that the army is
convoyed. If we allow this, then we get all issues related to
multi-route convoying back. So, I do not prefer that path
specification is required in face to face games (I have not seen any
house rules for manually adjudicated games, that require path
specification). Since, I prefer that face to face games are played as
much as possible the same as postal and email games, and since I
prefer that is played according to rules I prefer that path
specifications are not required and ignored (choice a). However, for
compatibility reasons I can also live when both are allowed (choice
b) but only for automated judge systems.</I>

is only significant when the units move in opposite direction.
However, when two units move in opposite direction, they do not
necessary be engaged in a head to head battle. It is possible that

<P><A NAME="4.B.5"></A><I>I do agree with the concept of mister
Calhamer that players should be in evident agreement on the moves.
Therefore, I do not like choice e. However, mister Calhamer is a
conceptual thinker and not a rule thinker. In the research for this
document I found some evidence that automated judges changed the
adjudication in favor of choice d after some complains. If the
conceptual right choice c of mister Calhamer is compared with the
practical choice d, the following two situations must be considered.
The first situation with choice c is that a person gives a support to
another player, but that support fails because the coast was missing.
The second situation is with choice d that a person gives a support
to another player without coast specification and the other player
betrays and moves to the not expected coast. Both situations are
undesirable and must be avoided if possible. However, I consider the
first situation far more likely to happen then the second situation.
Furthermore in the second situation the support giving player had
still the opportunity to avoid the unexpected move by specifying the
coast (this is not completely true since the other player could
pressure the player to give support without coast, but this is not
very likely since that would be very suspicious). Finally, choice d
is easier for new players, because the issue does not need to be
mentioned and the adjudication is with or without coast specification
more or less what they expect. For this reason I consider choice d
the most supportive for the game and that is why I prefer that coasts
may omitted, but must match when they are specified (choice d).</I>

allows multiple interpretations. 
</P>
<P>In the 1971 and 1982 rulebooks, the distance of each unit to the
home supply centers must be calculated. The distance must be
calculated by &quot;the shortest available route, including convoys&quot;.
This allows multiple interpretations. Must fleets be available for
convoying? And must convoys be calculated as one move? 
</P>
<P>The 2000 rulebook is even more vague about this. The distance must
be calculated to the &quot;country&quot;. The term 'home supply
centers' is not used. Taking the word 'country' literally means that
also some provinces without supply center must be taken into account
(for example, Apulia as part of Italy). Furthermore, information how
the distance should be calculated is also less clear then the in the
1971 and 1982 rulebooks (the word 'convoy' is not used).

<P><I>I interpret the 2000 rule just as the 1971 and 1982 rule. There
was no reason to change this rule and the change in formulation was
probably an attempt to simplify the formulation, with the consequence
that the rule became just more vague. Taking country literally
instead of home supply centers has some severe drawbacks. First it
means that in some cases an unit has to be removed in a home supply
center. Second, on some alternative maps the ownership of areas is
not drawn. And finally, for automatic adjudicators it would require
that they know the ownership of every area. This is currently not
implemented and it will probably never be implemented for just the

mess, that it is defendable decision to just take the rule from the

<H3 CLASS="western">4.E. MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES</H3>
<H4 CLASS="western"><A NAME="4.E.1"></A>4.E.1 ILLEGAL ORDERS</H4>
<P>&quot;legal&quot; is one of the most controversial terms in the
rules of Diplomacy. Of course, the same counts for the opposite
&quot;illegal&quot;. This term has two aspects. First its use and
consequences and second the definition which orders are legal and
which are not. Both aspects can be disputed. About the consequences
the 2000 rulebook says on page 3 (rather similar to the other
rulebooks):</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A legal order must be followed. An order written by
mistake, if legal, must be followed. An &quot;illegal&quot; or
ambiguous order or an order that is judged to be unsuccessful is not
followed. A unit that is given an illegal order (or given no order)
must stand in place. (The unit holds.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In this document this is interpreted that to determine whether an
order is legal or not is the first step in processing the orders. Any
legal orders are added to the set of orders to be adjudicated, while
the remaining is thrown away. That means that illegal orders do not
have influence whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>This is considered a workable and sensible usage of the term
'legal', however some other documents do not use it this way. For
instance, in the DPTG illegal orders may still have some effect (an
illegal move can not be supported in a hold). It should be realized
that with such usage the term 'legal' does not have much meaning
other than that the order unconditionally fails. 
</P>
<P>Although it is now clear how the word 'legal' is used in this
document, which orders are legal or not, must still be defined. The
most significant question of this issue is, whether an impossible
move (for instance A Moscow - York), can receive support to hold.
Some argue that it is still a move and therefore the unit can not
receive hold support. Other people say that it is an illegal order
and those should be treated as a hold. This issue is not only about
interpreting the orders, but it has a real consequence for the
possibilities of the players. If impossible orders can receive hold
support, then it means that a holding unit can not refuse hold
support (by ordering an impossible move). This can lead to some
interesting tactical situations. See for instance the Diplomatic
Pouch, Winter 1995 Adjustments, Library of Diplomacy Tactics, Tactics
Problems, Problem 3. However, it should be realized that the
situation in the given problem is rather theoretical. 
</P>
<P>The legality of an order has also minor consequences. For
instance, in case an order receives a legal and a illegal order. The
illegal order must be ignored, so there is no problem by just
accepting only the legal order (see also issues <A HREF="#4.D.3">4.D.3</A>
and <A HREF="#4.D.4">4.D.4</A> and test case <A HREF="#6.D.28">6.D.28</A>).
</P>
<P>Finally, the legality of orders is very important in &quot;no-press
games&quot;, since illegal orders will be shown as hold orders to
other players while legal attempts to move will be shown as they are
ordered. 
</P>
<P>For listing the possible interpretations of 'legal', another term
must be introduced. This is the concept of 'valid' orders. A valid
order is an order for which a successful attempt can be executed,
given all the other orders. More specific, non-matching support are
invalid. Non-matching convoy orders or convoy orders that are not
part of an ordered convoy route are also invalid. Even so, if a move
order requires a convoy and no convoy path is ordered, then the move
order is invalid. So, it is quite normal that during the game lot of
orders turn out to be invalid. This terminology is consistent with
the rulebooks. The 2000 rulebook uses the words 'valid' and 'invalid'
first on page 7 in relation with the matching of orders. 
</P>
<P>Note, that in the definition of 'valid' the word 'attempt' is
used. It is not necessary that the order actually succeeds or can
succeed. If Portugal is occupied by an army and the Mid-Atlantic
Ocean is empty, then a move order from Spain to Portugal can never
succeed. However, that move order is perfectly valid. 
</P>

	the order as an order to move? My inclination is to draw the line
	this way: an order to move to any space on the board, no matter how
	impossible, is an order to move within the meaning of Rule IX.6.
	This would include such orders as A Mun-Mos, A Mun-Switzerland, A
	Hol-Nth, F Pie-Ven, F StP(nc)-Mos, and so on. <BR><BR>On the other
	hand, if the unit is ordered to do some other thing, not involving a

	A Mun-Oz, A Mun loot and pillage, A Mun-Mars (but not A Mun-Mar),

	doing an impossible move. However, armies in coastal areas can
	almost always refuse support with certainty by ordering a move that
	requires a convoy for which the fleets are currently not in

	should be realized that a fleet can't convoy and support at the same

<P>Interpretation a has as disadvantage that almost every sentence
that contains a hyphen must be treated as a legal order. For the

rule. 
</P>
<P>Interpretations a and b have as disadvantage that in fact three
types of orders are distinguished. Legal orders that can be valid,
illegal orders that are ignored completely and semi-legal orders that

types introduces an additional complexity in the settling of some
disputes. For instance, in the DPTG, the group of semi-legal orders
are called 'illegal'. This makes it unclear whether a unit that is

support.

<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5"></A>5. THE PROCESS OF ADJUDICATION</H3>
<P>Writing a Diplomacy adjudicator program may look not more
difficult than writing a program that checks the moves of a chess
game. However, the contrary is true. A Diplomacy adjudicator that
passes all test cases as described in this document contains many
small and difficult details. 
</P>
<P>To help with writing an adjudicator program or just with the
manual adjudication, the adjudication of Diplomacy is analyzed here.
The first step in understanding the adjudication is to understand the
principle that a set of orders leads to a set of decisions to be
made. One order may lead to multiple decisions to made. For instance,
when a unit is ordered to move, it can be decided that the move
fails, but when the move uses a convoy, then it has also to be
decided whether the unit has any influence on the area where it was
ordered to move. 
</P>
<P>The second step is to understand that the decisions depend on each
other. Certain decisions can only be made when other decisions are
made first. For instance, when the units are ordered to follow each
other in a move, then the decision of the unit moves at the end
depends on the move decision of the unit at the front. 
</P>
<P>In the final step an algorithm is constructed. This algorithm is
based on the decisions and respects their dependencies. In some other
descriptions, such as the DPTG, the notion of &quot;decision&quot; is
not described and the algorithm is described directly. This has as
disadvantage that it gives no understanding of adjudication and why
the algorithm is constructed as it is. Furthermore, with such
description it is rather hard to look to alternative algorithms. We
will see that there are at least two ways to tackle the problem of an
adjudication program. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="5.A"></A>Note that in the adjudication description some
sanity checks are left out. For example a test whether a support
order matches with the order of the unit it supports. These are
covered by the test cases and are not relevant for the understanding
of the process of adjudication. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">5.A. OVERVIEW OF ADJUDICATION DECISIONS</H3>
<P>There are eight different types of decisions. Each type of
decisions is given a name, to refer easily to that decision type. To
distinguish the decision type of the other text, the name is given in
CAPITALS. 
</P>
<P>The first three decisions are directly related to the success or
failure of an order: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">MOVE<BR>Decision will result in
	'moves' or 'fails'. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">SUPPORT<BR>Decision will result in
	'given' or 'cut'. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>DISLODGE<BR>Decision will result in 'sustains' or
	'dislodged'. 
	</P>
</UL>
<PRE CLASS="western">Example:
Italy: 
A Tyrolia - Trieste
A Venice Supports A Tyrolia - Trieste

Austria: 
F Trieste Hold</PRE><P>
At the end of adjudication, the MOVE decision of Tyrolia is 'moves',
the SUPPORT decision of Venice is 'given' and the DISLODGE decision
of the army in Trieste is 'dislodged'. 
</P>
<P>When a unit tries to dislodge another unit, then the strength of
the move must be calculated and if that strength is larger than the
hold strength of the other unit, then the move of the unit succeeds.
So, the following two decision types are needed: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">ATTACK STRENGTH<BR>For each unit
	ordered to move, the strength to attack. A decision that results in
	a value equal or greater than zero. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>HOLD STRENGTH<BR>For each area on the board the strength to
	prevent that other units move to that area. A decision that results
	in a value equal or greater than zero. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Both ATTACK STRENGTH and HOLD STRENGTH are numerical decisions,
because the result of the decision is a number. 
</P>
<P>In the previous example the ATTACK STRENGTH of the army in Tyrolia
is two, while the HOLD STRENGTH of the army in Trieste is one. 
</P>
<P>A unit can not dislodge a unit of the same player. Also supports
to a foreign unit can not be used to dislodge an own unit. However,
these supports can be used to prevent that another unit enters the
area. This strength can be greater than ATTACK STRENGTH and must also
be calculated: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>PREVENT STRENGTH<BR>A numerical decision for each unit
	ordered to move. It is the strength to prevent other units to move
	to the area where it is ordered to move. A decision that results in
	a value equal or greater than zero. 
	</P>
</UL>
<PRE CLASS="western">Example:
Austria: 
A Vienna - Tyrolia
A Tyrolia - Munich
A Trieste Supports A Vienna - Tyrolia

Germany: 
A Munich Supports A Venice - Tyrolia
A Venice - Tyrolia</PRE><P>
The ATTACK STRENGTH of the army in Vienna is zero, because it can not
dislodge its own unit in Tyrolia. However, the PREVENT STRENGTH of
the army in Vienna is two, which prevents that the move of the German
army in Venice with an ATTACK STRENGTH of two succeeds. 
</P>
<P>When a unit is dislodged in a head to head battle, then the unit
has no effect anymore on the area it was ordered to move. This means
that the PREVENT STRENGTH is zero. However, it is still required to
calculate the strength that prevents the opposite unit in the head to
head battle to move. This value can be greater than ATTACK STRENGTH
since all support has to be calculated. Therefore a separate
numerical decision is necessary: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>DEFEND STRENGTH<BR>For each unit ordered to move in a head to
	head battle, the strength to defend its own area from the other unit
	of the head to head battle to enter. A decision that results in a
	value equal or greater than zero. 
	</P>
</UL>
<PRE CLASS="western">Example:
France: 
A Belgium Supports A Burgundy - Ruhr
A Holland Supports A Burgundy - Ruhr
A Burgundy - Ruhr
A Munich Supports A Ruhr - Burgundy
A Marseilles - Burgundy

Germany: 
A Ruhr - Burgundy</PRE><P>
In this example the French army in Munich supports the move of the
German army in Ruhr instead of the French army in Burgundy. This
makes that the ATTACK STRENGTH, the PREVENT STRENGTH and the DEFEND
STRENGTH of the German army in Ruhr are all different. The ATTACK
STRENGTH is one, because the French support should not be counted for
the attack. The PREVENT STRENGTH is zero, because it is dislodged by
the French army in Burgundy and therefore it can not prevent the army
in Marseilles to go to Burgundy. However, the DEFEND STRENGTH
contains all supports and is therefore two. Still this DEFEND
STRENGTH is insufficient in the head to head battle, since the French
army in Burgundy has an ATTACK STRENGTH of three. 
</P>
<P>It is important to understand the difference between PREVENT
STRENGTH and DEFEND STRENGTH. In some algorithms this is calculated
by the same routine. The returned strength of such routine depends on
the moment in the adjudication process. However, in this analysis
decisions are defined independent from the moment in the adjudication
process and therefore these two strengths needs to be distinguished. 
</P>
<P>Finally, when an army is ordered to move and the move will be
convoyed, it has to be decided whether the convoy will succeed: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>PATH<BR>For each unit ordered to move, the decision whether
	there is a path from the source to the destination. This decision
	will result in 'path' or 'no path'. When the move is without any
	convoy, the decision always results in 'path'. 
	</P>
</UL>

A Yorkshire - Belgium
F North Sea Convoys A Yorkshire - Belgium

Germany: 
F Holland Supports F Denmark - North Sea
F Denmark - North Sea</PRE><P>
<A NAME="5.B"></A>The fleet in the North Sea is dislodged, therefore
the PATH decision of the Yorkshire order is 'no path'. The PATH
decisions of non-convoying units are always 'path'. In this case the
PATH decisions of the moving fleet in Denmark is 'path'. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">5.B. PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF MAKING DECISIONS</H3>
<P>Before the description of how the different decisions must
precisely be made, the notion of 'undecided' must be introduced. In
the examples of the previous section the final result of decisions
were given. But during the adjudication, decisions are made one by
one and it must be possible to distinguish between decisions that are
already made and decisions that are not made yet. This is simply
achieved by introducing an 'undecided' status for the decisions that
have two possible outcomes. So, a MOVE decision can have the status
'moves', 'fails' or 'undecided'. The decisions SUPPORT, DISLODGE and
PATH decisions can also have the status 'undecided'. For the
numerical decisions two values are administrated. The minimum values
and the maximum values. The final result will be somewhere in the
interval between the minimum and maximum value. During adjudication
this interval will become smaller. The minimum values can only
increase, while the maximum can only decrease. When the minimum and
maximum value of a decision become equal, then the decision is fully
made. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="5.B.1"></A>Initially all numerical decisions have a
minimum value of zero and a maximum value of infinity. The remaining
decisions are initially 'undecided'.

<A NAME="5.B.2"></A>This MOVE decision has only one 'fails' result.
For proper reporting of the adjudication result to the players, more
information might be appropriate. For instance, if a move fails due
to a move of another unit to the same area, this could be reported as
'bounce'. Also the exact bouncing unit might be listed in the report.
This can be implemented by introducing different 'fails' as result of
the MOVE decision result. Or this information could be part of the

such algorithm a search function is called recursively. Normally,
such recursive function would only have two possible outcomes,
'failure' or 'success'. In this case it has three possible outcomes.
The recursive function first checks whether it is on the destination

</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">5.B.9. CIRCULAR MOVEMENT AND PARADOXES</H4>
<P>It is possible that during adjudication according to the given
prescriptions of making decisions, a situation occurs that no
decision can be made anymore while there are still decisions to make.
At such moment the board contains a circular movement or convoy
paradox. Those situations need special treatment. 
</P>
<P>The first step in resolving a circular movement or paradox is to
determine which decisions are part of the circular movement or the
paradox core. This is achieved by listing for each decision the
decisions it directly depends on. Decisions that are fully decided
are completely left out of this procedure. When these lists are made,
these lists are extended with all the indirect decisions
dependencies. This is continued until each decision has a list with
all direct and indirect (with possible multiple indirections)
dependencies. Every list forms a paradox, but the smallest dependency
list is a paradox core and only that list should be considered. Note
that there are probably more than one dependency lists with an equal
and smallest number of dependencies. It is unimportant which one of
these lists is selected. 
</P>
<P>In the second step the dependency list is analyzed. If the list of
decisions contains an undecided MOVE decision of a unit that targets
a fleet with a convoy order, then there is a convoy disruption
paradox. If there is no such decision, then there is a circular
movement. Note that if one of the moving units in a circular movement
moved with certainty due to a support, then the adjudication of the
circular movement would have been resolved in the normal process
adjudication. 
</P>
<P>In the final step the circular movement or paradox is enforced by
special rules and the normal decision making process can continue. In
case of a circular movement, all the MOVE decisions of the dependency
list are resolved to 'moves'. In case of convoy disruption paradox, a
convoy paradox rule must be applied on the dependency list. Note that
the MOVE decision of the army that convoys is not in the dependency
list, since for the paradox only the cutting of support is essential.
Therefore only the ATTACK STRENGTH decision of the army that convoys
appears in the dependency list. This is important when applying the
Szykman rule or the 'All Hold' rule. 
</P>
<P>When the Szykman rule is applied, all ATTACK STRENGTH decisions in
the dependency list are set to zero for both minimum as maximum. The
corresponding MOVE decision is set to failed and the corresponding
PREVENT STRENGTH is also to zero for both minimum as maximum. 
</P>
<P>If you interpret the 2000 rulebook in such that in some very rare
cases the attacked unit is dislodged by the convoying army (see
discussion in issue <A HREF="#4.A.2">4.A.2</A>, and test case
<A HREF="#6.F.17">6.F.17</A>), then first the dependency list must be
searched for a SUPPORT decision of a support order of an attack on a
convoying fleet that convoys an army to the area of the supporting
unit. That SUPPORT decision must be set to 'given'. If no such
decision could be found, then the 2000 rulebook has no resolution and
a fallback rule must be used such as the Szykman rule or the 'All
Hold' rule. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="5.B.10"></A>Variant rules may introduce new kind of
paradoxes (see test cases <A HREF="#9.E">9.E</A>, <A HREF="#9.F">9.F</A>
and <A HREF="#9.G">9.G</A>). If those rules are included, then it is
dangerous to conclude that there is a circular movement in case the
dependency list does not contain a convoy disruption paradox. It is
better to check if the moving units of all the MOVE decisions of the
dependency list are part of one single circular movement. If so,
these units advance, but if not then a fallback paradox rule must be
applied. In this fallback scenario all the MOVE decisions of the
dependency list resolve in 'fails' and all the SUPPORT decisions of
the list resolve in 'cut'. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">5.B.10. HEAD TO HEAD BATTLES DEPENDENT ON
ADJUDICATION</H4>
<P>In most interpretations of the rules, it can directly determined
whether two units that move in opposite direction will fight a head
to head battle or try to swap (by using a convoy). This can be
decided before any adjudication. However, if issue <A HREF="#4.A.3">4.A.3</A>
is interpreted according to choice c, then the convoy route to the
adjacent place must be adjudicated before it can be decided whether
the moves will result in a head to head battle. 
</P>
<P>The adjudication of this has some additional complexities. It can
be implemented by introducing a new decision 'HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE'.
This decision should have as result whether two units that move in
opposite direction, will fight a head to head battle or not. The MOVE
decision, the ATTACK STRENGTH decision and the PREVENT STRENGTH
decision must be changed such that they use the HEAD TO HEAD BATTLE
decision. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="5.B.11"></A>For the implementation of the HEAD TO HEAD
BATTLE decision, the 'CONVOY PATH' decision must be introduced. When
there is a successful convoy path for at least one of the opposing
units, then there is no head to head battle, otherwise the units will
fight a head to head battle. The CONVOY PATH decision is similar to
the PATH decision, but will only result in 'path' when the unit can
move to the destination by using at least one convoying fleet. To
avoid duplication of code, the implementation of the PATH decision
can be simplified by using the CONVOY PATH decision. 
</P>
<H4 CLASS="western">5.B.11. RETREAT</H4>
<P>To which areas a unit may retreat, must be calculated after
adjudicating the main phase, because it depends on the orders given
in the main phase. It is insufficient to just mark the areas to which
a retreated is possible, since there are situation where one unit may
retreat to a certain, while another may not (see test case <A HREF="#6.H.10">6.H.10</A>
). So, for every dislodged unit a list of areas must be created to
which it may retreat. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="5.C"></A>How a retreat must be calculated is based on the
principle as worded in the rulebook: &quot;A dislodged unit must
retreat to an adjacent province that it could ordinarily move to if
unopposed by other units.&quot; That means that the logic of a
retreat is similar to the MOVE decision. A unit may retreat to an
area if the unit may move to the area directly (so, without convoy),
the PREVENT STRENGTH of all units that attempted to move to the area
is zero, the HOLD STRENGTH of the area is zero and there is no unit
that moved successfully in the opposite direction. All these
calculations must be made as part of the adjudication of the main
phase. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">5.C. FROM DECISIONS TO ALGORITHM</H3>
<P>In the final step the principle of decisions is transformed into
an algorithm. Whatever for algorithm is made, the decisions will
always be part of the algorithm one way or another. This is for the
simple reason that the decisions are directly based on the rules.
However, there are two fundamental different ways to deal with the
dependencies of the decisions: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A sequence based algorithm. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>A decision based algorithm. 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>In a sequence based algorithm, the program tackles the problem of
dependencies by making the decisions in a hard programmed sequence.
The sequence guarantees that when a decisions is made, any other
dependent decisions are already decided. For instance, the algorithm
will probably start by cutting supports. Then it will try to resolve
moves that will dislodge a convoying fleet and finally it will
resolve the moves. If a unit moves to an area where a second unit is
ordered to move, it will first resolve the move of the second unit.
This can be implemented by a recursive function. 
</P>
<P>The advantage of the sequence based algorithm is that it does not
need to have the administration of all the decisions. The decisions
do not require an 'undecided' state. A support decision is 'given'
until it is decided to be 'cut'. The sequence in which the decisions
are made, will guarantee that this will lead to the correct results.
It is not too difficult to make a sequence based algorithm that
handles the most common situations correctly. However, for a perfect
adjudicator that passes all test cases in this document and that
handles second order paradoxes according to the Szykman rule, a
sequence based algorithm becomes very complex. The DPTG is an example
of a sequence based algorithm and it shows the difficulties of
handling convoy paradoxes in a sequence based algorithm. 
</P>
<P>The alternative is the decision based algorithm. A decision based
algorithm starts with setting up the administration of the decisions
based on the orders. Initially all decisions are undecided. Then the
algorithm tries to make decisions one by one without paying attention
to the sequence. If a decision can not be made due to a dependency on
another decision, then the algorithm just goes to the next decision.
When all decisions are handled once this way, it just starts all over
again. It will repeat this until all decisions are made. It is also
possible that there are still decisions to be made, but none of them
can be decided. The algorithm detects it, resolved the circular
movement or applies a paradox rule on the remaining decisions and
restarts the decision process. 
</P>
<P>The key principle in a decision based algorithm, is that when a
decision is made, then that decision is final. This principle is
necessary because of the undefined sequence in which decisions are
made. If a decision would be changed, then a second decision that is
based on that decision would have a result dependent if the decision
would be made before or after the change. So, in such case the result
becomes dependent on the (undefined) sequence and therefore there is
no guarantee that the result will be correct. 
</P>
<P>The advantage of a decision based algorithm above a sequence based
algorithm is that the logic of the sequence does not need to be
programmed. The disadvantage is that all decisions have to be
programmed twice. Once for deciding if the decision fails (or the
minimum in case of a numerical decision) and once for deciding if the
decision succeeds (or the maximum in case of a numerical decision).
But still, if a fully correct algorithm is required it is probably
much easier to write a decision based algorithm then a sequence based
algorithm. The decisions are close to the original text of the
rulebook. It is also easier to add variant rules since any impact on
the sequence does not need to programmed. A second disadvantage of a
decision based algorithm is the additional memory administration of
the decisions, however as we will see, this can be simplified. 
</P>
<P>In a program with a decision based algorithm, two functions for
each decision can be recognized. One function that returns the
current status of the decision and another function that updates it.
For instance the functions for the ATTACK STRENGTH decision would
look like: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">    current_ATTACK_STRENGTH(
                in    order_type          order,
                out   integer             min_strength,
                out   integer             max_strength)

    boolean update_ATTACK_STRENGTH(
                in    order_type          order)</PRE><P>
The update function contains the logic as described in section <A HREF="#5.B">5.B</A>.
It returns a boolean value. This value is set when the status of the
decision has been changed. If in an iteration there is no change in
the status of the decisions, then all the decision are made or a
paradox is detected. 
</P>
<P>For breaking a circular movement or a paradox, the dependencies
has to be calculated. Each decision should have a list of
dependencies. When this process is started, these lists are set to
empty. Furthermore, for each decision two additional function are
required. One function that adds the current dependencies of a
decision to a list. It also adds itself to the list. The other
function updates the dependencies of a decision. For the ATTACK
STRENGTH decision this would look like: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">    boolean add_dependencies_ATTACK_STRENGTH(
                in    order_type          order,
                inout decision_list_type  dependencies)

    boolean update_dependencies_ATTACK_STRENGTH(
                in    order_typ           order)</PRE><P>
<A NAME="5.D"></A>Decisions that are fully decided, are not added to
the dependency lists. Both functions return a boolean value. This
value is set when anything is changed to the dependency list. For
calculating the dependencies, the update functions should repeatedly
called until there are no changes in the dependencies anymore. The
decisions of the circular movement or paradox are located by taking
the decision with the smallest dependency list. The decisions of the
dependency list should be further examined (see section <A HREF="#5.B.9">5.B.9</A>).
After the circular movement or paradox is resolved, the program
should continue making decisions in the normal way. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western"><A NAME="5.D1"></A>5.D. SIMPLIFICATIONS AND
OPTIMIZATIONS</H3>
<P>The program as just described follows the principles of the
decisions in a straight forward way. However, some simplifications
and optimizations can be made. It is not necessary to have all kinds
of data structures for administrating the decisions. For most
decisions the 'current' function can be changed in such way that it
calculates the result, rather then taking the information out of data
structures. This means that are no data structures for that decision
type required and the logic of the 'update' function is moved to the
'current' function. The 'update' function itself becomes obsolete.
Only the administration of the MOVE and SUPPORT decisions should
remain. But this administration is very simple and is probably
already there. 
</P>
<P>If this simplification is chosen, then here is a small is issue
concerning paradox resolving. When the Szykman rule is applied, then
the decisions of type ATTACK STRENGTH and PREVENT STRENGTH are set to
zero. With the simplification this is not possible anymore, since
there is no administration of these decisions. Instead the decision
of the support of the attacked unit should set to 'given' and the
MOVE decision should be set to 'failed'. For the standard rules this
will give the same results, but theoretically a variant rule could be
designed where this makes a difference. This can be prevented by
adding a flag to the move order and let the 'current' functions of
the ATTACK STRENGTH and PREVENT STRENGTH check on this flag. However,
this is rather overzealous, since it is unlikely that such variant
rule would be invented. 
</P>
<P>The simplification is probably more efficient than the original.
In some cases a decision might be calculated more than once, but this
is compensated by the following facts: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">There is less effort in setting up
	the decision data. 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Some decisions (such as PREVENT
	STRENGTH) are only calculated when required. 
	</P>
	<LI><P>There are less decisions administrated and that means that in
	most cases there are less iterations necessary for the final result
	(for instance, simple support cuts will be decided in the first
	iteration, while without simplification this is only certain in the
	second iteration when all minimum values of the 'ATTACK STRENGTH'
	decisions will have at least the required value of one for a support
	cut). 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>The program can be further optimized by trying to calculate the
MOVE and SUPPORT decisions when they are requested and when they are
still undecided. This means that the 'current' function and 'update'
function are also merged for the MOVE and SUPPORT decisions. This
leads to recursive calls and without precaution this may lead to an
endless recursion. This is prevented by introducing a flag for each
MOVE and SUPPORT decision (it is not necessary to introduce this flag
for the other decisions). When such decision is calculated, the flag
is set and when such decision is requested it will not start
calculating it when the flag is already set. 
</P>
<P>If an endless recursion is detected, then it is not necessarily a
paradox. Consider the following situation: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">France: 
A Gascony - Burgundy
A Ruhr Supports A Gascony - Burgundy

Germany: 
A Burgundy Supports A Kiel - Ruhr
A Kiel - Ruhr</PRE><P>
When the French order of the army in Gascony is calculated, the
following calls will be made: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">MOVE(Gascony - Burgundy)
  ATTACK STRENGTH(Gascony - Burgundy)
    SUPPORT(Ruhr Support A Gascony - Burgundy)
      ATTACK STRENGTH(Kiel - Ruhr)
        SUPPORT(Burgundy Supports A Kiel - Ruhr)
          ATTACK STRENGTH(Gascony - Burgundy)
            SUPPORT(Ruhr Support A Gascony - Burgundy)
              ...</PRE><P>
In the last call for the calculation of the success of the support of
the army Ruhr, an endless recursion is detected (there is no endless
recursion detection in the routine that calculates the ATTACK
STRENGTH). In this situation the function must give as result that
this support is still 'undecided'. However, this does not mean that
the adjudication fails. The last ATTACK STRENGTH call for the army in
Gascony will have a minimum result of 1 and a maximum result of 2.
This is enough to decide that the SUPPORT of the army in Burgundy
fails. All the other decisions can then be made. 
</P>
<P>A similar situation can occur with circular movement. When one of
the moving units is supported and moves unconditionally or one of the
moving units is blocked by a unit not part of the circular movement,
then an endless recursion will be detected due to circular movement,
but finally all the decisions will still be adjudicated. 
</P>
<P>An interesting case is the example on page 16 of the 2000
rulebook: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">France: 
A Tunis - Naples
F Tyrrhenian Sea Convoys A Tunis - Naples
F Ionian Sea Convoys A Tunis - Naples

Italy: 
F Naples Supports F Rome - Tyrrhenian Sea
F Rome - Tyrrhenian Sea</PRE><P>
For the army in Tunis, the PATH decision has to be calculated. For
this calculation a search routine will be used and this routine may
first try the route via the Tyrrhenian Sea. This leads to the
following calls: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">MOVE(Tunis - Naples)
  ATTACK STRENGTH(Tunis - Naples)
    PATH(Tunis - Naples)
      DISLODGE(Tyrrhenian Sea)
        MOVE(Rome - Tyrrhenian Sea)
          ATTACK STRENGTH(Rome - Tyrrhenian Sea)
            SUPPORT(Naples Supports
                    F Rome - Tyrrhenian Sea)
              ATTACK STRENGTH(Tunis - Naples)
                PATH(Tunis - Naples)
                  DISLODGE(Tyrrhenian Sea)
                    MOVE(Rome - Tyrrhenian Sea)</PRE><P>
Finally, in the last MOVE call, the endless recursions is detected.
Still, this does not lead to a failure in adjudication, since the
routine that calculates the PATH decisions will eventually try the
route via Ionian Sea and this opens the possibility for making the
other decisions. 
</P>
<P>In case there is no way to make a decision anymore, then the
mechanism of endless recursion detection can also be used to
determine the paradox core. This simplifies the algorithm further,
since it eliminates the need for calculating and administration of
dependencies lists. For each MOVE and SUPPORT decision not only a
flag must be maintained whether this decision has already been
attempted to calculate in the recursion, but also an identification
that refers to the previous calculation of the MOVE or SUPPORT
decision in the recursion. When the endless recursion is detected,
then these identification can be traversed until the identification
is encountered of the decision where the endless recursion is
detected (you should not use all the decisions currently be
calculated in the recursion, but only those decisions that are
circular dependent). This set of decisions form a circular movement
or form the paradox core. These can treated as described earlier.
Since these decisions are now made, they should not be altered when
the functions return out of the recursion. Therefore there should be
a way to signal that a paradox or circular movement has been resolved
and that no further decisions should be made when returning out of
the recursion. Another way is that the MOVE and SUPPORT decision
functions recheck the status of the decision after they have called
other functions. 
</P>
<P>Resolving circular movement and paradoxes this way, may only be
done when adjudication really fails. When an endless recursion is
detected, then it must be clear whether adjudication should just
continue or whether circular movement or paradoxes should be handled.
To distinguish these two situation an additional flag is needed. This
flag can be a global variable. The main routine of adjudication
becomes something like this: 
</P>
<PRE CLASS="western">LOOP i OVER ALL SUPPORT AND MOVE ORDERS
    WHILE ORDER i IS UNDECIDED
        # Calculate order without attempting to
        # handle circular movement or paradoxes.
        BREAK_CIRCULAR_MOVEMENT_OR_PARADOX = FALSE
        CALCULATE ORDER i
        IF ORDER i IS UNDECIDED
            # Adjudication has now locked up. There is
            # a circular movement or paradox. Retry the
            # same order, but now with handling of
            # circular movement and paradoxes.
            BREAK_CIRCULAR_MOVEMENT_OR_PARADOX = TRUE
            CALCULATE ORDER i
        END IF
    END WHILE
END LOOP</PRE><P>
This trick of determining circular movement or the paradox core works
only, because circular movement or the paradox core consists always
of a single circular dependency list. If a paradox sensitive variant
rule is added that introduces more complex paradox cores, then this
trick won't work. In such case the original method of calculating the
smallest dependency list should be used. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="5.E"></A>As you can see, with these simplifications the
program is not that large. Besides the main function and some
pre-processing functions, you have only one function for each
decision. The administration is also minimal. For the MOVE and
SUPPORT orders a flag for endless recursions detection and
identification that refers to the previous MOVE or SUPPORT order in
the recursion. 
</P>
<H3 CLASS="western">5.E. PERFORMANCE</H3>
<P>A comparison of execution speed with a sequence based algorithm is
difficult to give. Both ways have their advantages and disadvantages
in execution speed. Finally, it should be noted that this is only
important for artificial intelligence programs, because for normal
adjudication the time is not noticeable even on a slow computer. 
</P>
<P>If execution speed is really important, then one should optimize
the most common situation. Sometimes programmers try to optimize the
rare situations, however this useless and may in fact lead to slower
programs, because of the additional logic. The decision based
algorithm is rather inefficient in the most common support cuts.
Since most adjudication decisions consists of simple support and move
orders, this is probably a good candidate for optimization. Before
the decision algorithm is started, set all the support orders on
'given'. Then loop on all move orders. If a move order is to an area
with a unit with a support order, then this support is 'cut' when the
move is direct (so, without convoy) and the support is not for a move
to the starting position of the move. Otherwise, the support is set
to 'undecided' when it was not yet 'cut'. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="6"></A>This pre-processing phase will decide most of the

of Italy is illegal, because a unit may only support to an area where
the unit can go by itself. A unit can't go to the area it is already
standing, so the Italian order is illegal and the German move from
Berlin succeeds. Even if it would be legal, the German move from

the support of the fleet in Naples is not cut and the fleet in Rome

<P>If the 1971 rule is used about multi-route convoys (when one of
the routes is disrupted, the convoy fails), the Italian convoy order
in the Ionian Sea is not part of the convoy, because it is a foreign

Sea is not a 'convoying' fleet. In all rulings the support of Naples
on the Ionian Sea is cut and the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged
by the Turkish fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>When the 1982 rule is used about multi-route convoy disruption,

<P>If the Szykman rule, the 'All Hold' rule or DPTG is used, then

Since England ordered the army in Norway to move explicitly via

If the rulebook is taken literally (choice a), then a dislodged unit
can not bounce a unit in the area where the attacker came from. This
would mean that the move of the fleet in the Norwegian Sea succeeds

is still possible, when there is no head to head battle. So, the

<P>Clarifications: TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILROAD 
</P>
<P>9.21 Only the Russian player may use the TSR. The Russian player
may not allow another power to use it. 
</P>
<P>9.23 This rule restricts the attack capability of units using the
TSR 
</P>
<P>A unit using the TSR may attack:<BR>(1) a province that is
unoccupied at the start of the turn. Normal rules of conflict would
apply,<BR>(2) a province that is occupied at the start of the turn
but was made empty during the current turn as a result of that unit
moving out. Normal rules of conflict would apply, or<BR>(3) a
province that is occupied at the start of the turn, but if the unit
remains in place then the attack will be unsuccessful (even with
support) and the unit will have to stop in the nearest empty province
along the line of the railroad before the enemy-occupied province
(e.g. An army in Moscow with orders A MOS-TSR-VLA with an enemy unit
holding in Vladivostok results in the Moscow army stopping in Irkutsk
--the order is legal, in the hope that the province will be vacated,
but unsuccessful). 
</P>
<P>Note: So long as an enemy unit remains in place it may not be
successfully attacked that turn by a unit using the TSR. This still
applies even if that enemy unit is attacked by a third power that
turn and forced to retreat, for example: Russia A MOS-TSR-VLA China A
VLA HOLD Japan A SEO-VLA, F OS S A SEO-VLA 
</P>
<P>The Russian unit stops in Irkutsk. The Chinese unit retreats (not
to Irkutsk or Seoul). The Japanese unit from Seoul takes Vladivostok.
</P>
<P>9.241 The presence of a foreign power in a province along the line
of the TSR blocks its use beyond that point. However, if the unit
later moves off this province thus unblocking the line, the TSR may
again function normally, that is, control of the province reverts to
Russia (it is assumed the partisans rebuild the line). 
</P>
<P>EXCEPTION: If a supply center on the line of the TSR (Moscow,
Omsk, Vladivostok) is captured by an enemy power and later vacated,
ownership remains with that power and the TSR is out at that point
until Russia is able to recapture the province. Only then is the line
&quot;open&quot; again. For example, if China owns Omsk but has
vacated it, a Russian unit using the TSR from Vladivostok could move
to Omsk, but no further that turn. 
</P>
<P>9.25 A curious example of this rule applies if an enemy unit
attacks from one province to another along the line of the TSR at the
same time that a Russian unit is railed through these provinces in
the same direction such as: 
</P>
<P>Russia A VLA-TSR-OMSK China A KRA-OMSK 
</P>
<P>This results in a standoff in Omsk. The Chinese unit stays in
Krasnoyarsk and the Russian unit stays in Irkutsk. The logic being
that Krasnoyarsk is left empty by the Chinese at the time the Russian
unit moves through. Thus both units attack Omsk and cause a standoff.
NOTE: The above result would also have occurred if the Russian unit
had been ordered to Perm or Moscow because the same standoff would
still occur in Omsk. 
</P>
<P>SUGGESTED ADDITION TO MAP The island of Sakhalin is contained
entirely within the Okhotsk Sea and a unit there cannot be
eliminated, so it is suggested that a - land bridge - arrow should
connect Otaru and Sakhalin thus allowing a supported attack from
Otaru and Okhotsk Sea to take Sakhalin. 
</P>
<P>CEBU Cebu is one space containing both land and sea. It can be

Lower Pacific, Davao, Sulu Sea and Luzon Strait.

</P>
<P>Q. In the following situation, where do A Mos and A Omsk end up?
Russian orders: A Mos-TSR-Vla, A Omsk-Kra, A Vla-Seo; Chinese orders:
A Mac-Irk.<BR>A. The standoff in Kra means that A Omsk does not move
and A Mos stops in Perm. 
</P>
<P>Q. If Russia orders A Mos-TRS-Vla and China orders A Mac-Irk and A
Mon-Kra, what happens?<BR>A. A Mon-Kra fails, A Mac-Irk succeeds, A
Mos stops in Omsk.

<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A move with the Trans-Siberian

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Russian army can rail through

	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A Russian army using the
	Trans-Siberian Railroad can only receive support on the final part
	of the move.<BR>Since there is no notation for support on other

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">A move with the Trans-Siberian
	Railroad can not cut support.<BR>According to the errata an attack
	will be unsuccessful when a unit stays in place. So, it is assumed

	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">When a unit is ordered to go with
	the Trans-Siberian Railroad and the first place the unit has to pass
	contains another unit moving in the opposite direction, then the
	Trans-Siberian Railroad order should be treated as a normal move to
	the first place the unit wanted to pass, but without the ability
	dislodging the other unit.<BR>So, in such case there is just a head

<H4 CLASS="western">The Sakhalin story</H4>
<P>On the first print of the Colonial variant map there is no land
bridge between Sakhalin and Otaru and there is no land bridge between
Sakhalin Vladivostok. This introduces the problem that a unit in
Sakhalin can not be dislodged, because Sakhalin has only one neighbor
(Okhotsk Sea). Since this area has also a supply center, the area can
supply itself. 
</P>
<P>In the second print of the Colonial variant map and in the errata,
Avalon Hill &quot;corrected&quot; this problem by adding a land
bridge between Sakhalin and Otaru. However, this introduced a new
problem. Two units in Sakhalin and Otaru can support each other and
supply there selves forever. And some argue that this situation is
even worse then the original problem. 
</P>
<P>There are several ways to solve this problems. One of the most
common played versions is the &quot;Moulmein Convention&quot;. In
that convention there is a second additional land bridge between
Otaru and Akita. However, according to Peter Hawes, the lead designer
of the Colonial variant, the original design contained a land bridge
between Sakhalin and Vladivostok (and no land bridge between Sakhalin
and Otaru). Avalon Hill omitted this land bridge by mistake. You
should realize that this is a large change to the map and Avalon Hill
never made an errata in this direction. Some people argue that a land
bridge between Sakhalin and Vladivostok is very bad, because Japan
can be denied any build in the first build turn. However, that this
is not different from the standard game where at least England and
Russia can be denied any build in the first build turn. 
</P>
<P><A NAME="7.A"></A><I>I prefer the land bridge between Sakhalin and
Vladivostok. I think that the many land bridges in the Moulmein
Convention destroys the interesting geographical situation in that
area and makes it too easy for Japan to defend. A common complaint is
that Japan is too strong (to only way to beat Japan is to start
bashing it from the start of the game). With the land bridge between
Sakhalin and Vladivostok, Russia has to make a difficult choice. It
can take Sakhalin at the first turn (with a rather useless army on
Sakhalin) or try to move the army in the direction of Seoul and
Fusan. I think that this makes the situation much more interesting
and gives a better balance to the game.</I>
