<B>There is no discussion</B> when players have to retreat or make

<B>The two piece </B>types are: Army and Fleet.</P>

<B>If you are short</B> of pieces you build new ones in unoccupied
home centers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<B>If you have more</B> pieces than supply centers you must reduce
your pieces to equal the number of supply centers.</P>
<P LANG="en-US" CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; widows: 2; orphans: 2">
<B>Each piece has equal strength</B> so it moves with a force of 1

<B>An Army may move </B>or give support for another piece to move

<B>To force someone out </B>of a province requires that you have

Oddities : Kiel and Constantinople have a single coast due to their
waterways (Kiel Canal/Bosphorus) Denmark connects with Sweden so
armies can go between them but the Danish coast and Swedish coasts
are not divided in two. As a coast land province you may not convoy
through Denmark, Kiel or Constantinople.</P>
